After a bit of search here I found an answer from How do I clear space on my main system drive on a Linux CentOS system? that worked for me:

If you just want to look for big files and delete those then you could also use find

find / -type f -size +100M
would search for files only (-type f) with a size > 100MB (-size +100M)
subsequently you could use the same command to delete them.

find / -type f -size +100M -exec rm \{\} \;
-exec executes a program which gets passed the file or folder it has found ( {} ), needs to be terminated with \;

don't forget you could add -i to rm to approve or disapprove a deletion.
